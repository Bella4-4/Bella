<h2> My top 3 Movies. </h2>

<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) </h3>
<p>This animated superhero film is a visual masterpiece, 
    pushing the boundaries of animation with its unique blend of comic book aesthetics and stunning CGI. 
    Beyond its groundbreaking style, the movie boasts a heartfelt and engaging story about Miles Morales stepping into the Spider-Man role, 
    perfectly balancing humor, action, and emotional depth. The ensemble cast of Spider-people is fantastic, 
    and the film's message about anyone being able to wear the mask resonates powerfully. 
    It's not just a great superhero movie, but a truly great film, period.</p>
<h3>Parasite (2019)</h3>
<p>Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite" is a brilliant, genre-defying thriller that masterfully blends dark comedy, 
social commentary, and suspense. The film meticulously crafts a narrative about a poor family who infiltrates the lives of a wealthy one, 
leading to unforeseen and shocking consequences. It's a biting satire on class inequality, 
executed with incredible precision in its screenplay, direction, and performances. 
The twists and turns are genuinely surprising, keeping you on the edge of your seat until its unforgettable climax. 
"Parasite" is a thought-provoking, uncomfortable, and ultimately unforgettable cinematic experience.</p>
<h4>Arrival (2016)</h4>
<p>"Arrival" is a profoundly intelligent and emotionally resonant science fiction film that transcends typical alien invasion tropes. 
Directed by Denis Villeneuve, it stars Amy Adams as a linguist tasked with communicating with extraterrestrial visitors. T
he film is less about action and more about the power of communication, language, 
and the nature of time itself. It's a patient and contemplative movie that rewards thoughtful viewing, 
building to an incredibly moving and intellectually stimulating conclusion. 
The performances are superb, and the film's ability to be both a gripping mystery and a deeply philosophical exploration makes it a standout.</p>
